**Student:** Joud AlJabri — 202277140
**Assignment:** 2 — Interactive Features Portfolio Website

---

## 1. Overview

This portfolio is a two-page static website built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It presents my work, skills, and contact information in a personal aesthetic I designed myself — dark background, soft pink and green accents, and serif typography using the Bellefair font.

The site was fully redesigned from Assignment 1. The original version followed a more generic layout structure. After reflecting on the feedback and revisiting the design, I rebuilt it from scratch to better reflect my personal style and make it feel genuinely mine rather than a template.

---

## 2. Design Changes from Assignment 1

The redesign was not just cosmetic — it involved restructuring the entire layout and CSS:

- **Color palette:** Moved to a dark theme (`#1e1e1e` background) with `#FFA5C5` pink and `#BEEBA9` green as accent colors, chosen to match my personal aesthetic.
- **Typography:** Switched to Bellefair (Google Fonts), a serif typeface that gives the site a softer, more editorial feel.
- **Layout:** Hero section is now large and expressive with a floating sparkle animation. Sections flow naturally with generous padding instead of hard-bordered boxes.
- **Navigation:** The navbar now includes actual navigation links (Home, Projects, Blogs) as well as a clickable logo that scrolls back to the top — directly addressing the Assignment 1 feedback that flagged the nav for having no links to page sections. I am still wokring perosnally on the Blogs Page 🥰.

```

**CSS is organized into two files:** `index.css` handles global resets, CSS variables, the navbar, and every section on the main page. `projects.css` handles the layout and filter bar specific to the projects archive. This avoids loading unnecessary styles on each page.

**JavaScript is centralized** in one `script.js` file, loaded at the bottom of `index.html`. `projects.html` has its own small inline script for the filter feature since it does not share the main script.

## 5. Pages

### index.html — Main Portfolio
Contains the following sections in order:
- **Navbar** — fixed, blurs on scroll, has section links
- **Hero** — name, title, social links, floating sparkle decorations
- **Quote of the Day** — live API fetch with a button
- **About Me** — short bio and interests
- **Tech Stack** — skills grouped into 4 cards
- **Projects** — 3 featured project cards with a link to the full archive
- **Latest Fromm Github NEW** — display the 3 latest project from github
- **Contact** — validated contact form
- **Footer**

### projects.html — Full Archive
Contains all 13 projects with a filter bar that lets visitors filter by category: All, Mobile, Web, Python & Data, OOP, and UI/UX. Each project card has tags, a description, and links.

---

## 6. JavaScript Features

All features are in `js/script.js`.

### 6.1 Time-Based Greeting
On page load, `displayGreeting()` reads the visitor's local time using `new Date().getHours()` and updates the hero greeting text dynamically:

- Before 12:00 → "Good Morning, I'm"
- 12:00–17:59 → "Good Afternoon, I'm"
- 18:00 onward → "Good Evening, I'm"

This is a dynamic content feature that personalises the page on every visit without any user action required.

### 6.2 Quote of the Day (Public API)
A "New Quote" button triggers `getQuote()`, an `async` function that fetches a random quote from the public API `https://dummyjson.com/quotes/random`. The API requires no key and returns a JSON object with `quote` and `author` fields, which are injected into the page.

Error handling is included: if the fetch fails (e.g. no internet), the quote element displays "Failed to load quote." so the user is never left without feedback.

### 6.3 Contact Form Validation
On submit, the form is validated in JavaScript before any success state is shown:

- **Name** — must not be empty
- **Email** — must not be empty and must match the pattern `/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/`
- **Message** — must not be empty

If validation fails, a red error message is injected directly below the offending field and the field border turns red. All errors are cleared and re-evaluated on each submission attempt. On success, the button text changes to "✓ Sent!" and the fields clear. The button resets after 3 seconds.

### 6.4 Smooth Scroll Navigation
Clicking any nav link that points to an on-page section (`#home`, `#about`, etc.) uses `smoothScrollTo()` instead of the browser default jump. The function offsets the scroll target by the navbar height (72px) so the section heading is never hidden behind the fixed navbar.

Clicking the nav logo scrolls back to the top of the page.

### 6.5 Navbar Scroll Shadow
A `scroll` event listener adds the class `.scrolled` to the navbar once the user scrolls past 20px, which applies a box shadow. This gives a visual cue that the navbar is floating above content.

### 6.6 Project Filter (projects.html)
An inline script on `projects.html` listens for clicks on the filter bar buttons. Each project card has a `data-category` attribute. When a filter button is clicked, cards that do not match are hidden with `display: none` and the active button is highlighted. The "All" filter restores all cards.


### 6.7 Loading Github Repos
loadGitHubRepos() fetches https://api.github.com/users/Joudii18/repos?sort=updated&per_page=3 and renders cards showing: Repo name (links to GitHub), description, language, star count, fork count, and error message if the API fails

## 7. CSS & Animations

### CSS Variables
All colours, fonts, and recurring values are defined as custom properties in `:root` inside `index.css`, making the theme easy to adjust from one place.

### Animations & Transitions
- **Hover transitions** — nav links, buttons, and project link buttons all have `transition: color/background/opacity 0.2s` for smooth hover feedback.
- **Form focus** — inputs and textareas transition their border colour to pink on focus.
- **Floating sparkles** — the decorative sparkle images in the hero section use a `@keyframes float` animation that gently moves them up and down on a 6-second loop, with staggered `animation-delay` values so they don't move in sync.
- **Form validation errors** — error messages appear and disappear dynamically, giving immediate animated feedback.

### Responsive Design
Media queries handle layout changes at three breakpoints:

| Breakpoint | Changes |
|---|---|
| `max-width: 768px` (index) | Single-column tech grid, smaller sparkles or hidden, single-column project grid |
| `max-width: 900px` (projects) | Projects grid reduces to 2 columns |
| `max-width: 600px` (projects) | Projects grid becomes single column |

## 8. Accessibility & Best Practices

- All decorative images use `alt=""` so screen readers skip them.
- Meaningful images (project screenshots) have descriptive `alt` text.
- Form inputs use `autocomplete` attributes (`name`, `email`) to assist browser autofill.
- External links use `target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"` to avoid security issues with opener access.
- The HTML `lang="en"` attribute is set on both pages.
- `scroll-behavior: smooth` is set in CSS as a baseline, with the JS scroll handling layered on top for navbar offset accuracy.

## 9. Assignement 3 Requirements 

-  API Integration: Both quotes and github latest repo implemented
- Complex Logic: Create a project page  that can be filtered and sorted according to the tech stack used, including UI/UX, Web, Mobile and more.
- Complex Logic: Adde extra checks to contact forms filling like making sure fields are not empty.
- State Management: Added a dialog box for prompting the visisor name when they first visit the website, and stored it in localStrorage for later calling and to remember the preference.
- Performance: Compressed `MyFrame.png` from 1.5MB to under 200KB using WebP conversion via Squoosh. Added `loading="lazy"` to all project images so off-screen images are not downloaded until the user scrolls to them, reducing initial page load time.
